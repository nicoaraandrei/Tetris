# Tetris
A tetris implementation using jcanvas and html.

You can play it here http://nicoaraandrei.github.io/tetris/.

Instructions: Move with the keyboard arrows and R to rotate.

Tip: you can speed up the block fall by pressing down arrow key.

This is the first step of the gamedev path I want to follow so please be gentle.

~~My next goal is to add score and a preview of the next block(tetromino) you gonna get.~~
Now the next goal is to make the page be more visual appealing but for the moment I lack the required skills to do that. Maybe in the future, maybe.
