# Tetris

A tetris implementation using js, canvas and html. Play it live at http://nicoaraandrei.github.io/tetris/. Press the keyboard arrows to move, R to rotate, and spacebar to pause while playing or reset when the game is over.

Tip: you can speed up the block fall by pressing down arrow key.

This is the first step of the gamedev path I want to follow so please be gentle.
